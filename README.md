russia-elections
================

This repo uses the Significance article "Putin's peaks" (Kobak, Shpilkin, and Pshenichnikov (2018)) as a motivating example in ST541 Probability, Simulation and Computing in Statistics.

The original article code can be found at: <https://github.com/dkobak/elections/>

Outline
=======

1.  Get into groups of 3-4, each group will need a laptop.

2.  **Group Discussion** Discuss the answers to pre-lecture activity.

3.  **Class Discussion** Review answers and narrow focus to voter turnout in 2018.

4.  **Group Activity**

    -   Access the class workspace on RStudio cloud. Open `russia-elections` project and save a copy.
    -   Knit `01-data-import.Rmd`. What is reported by the polling stations? How is the turnout calculated from the available data? Compare the figures, does this data seem to match the paper?

5.  **Class Discssion** Clarify objective and relevant data.

6.  **Group Activity** `02-explore-analysis.Rmd` Find the number of *integer turnouts* in 2018.

7.  **Class Discssion** Why is this hard?

8.  **Class Discussion** Review Monte Carlo approach.

9.  **Group Activity** How would you simulate turnout at a polling station?

10. **Group Activity** Simulate a set of turnouts and find number of integer turnouts.

11. **Class Discussion** Collect integer turnouts, compare to observed integer turnout. Show a larger simulation.

12. **Class Discussion** What would be an alternative approach to the simulation?

13. Review main themes of course:

    -   **Computational alternatives to analytical techniques**: specific algorithms commonly encountered in statistics.
    -   **Programming for statistical computation**: code that is correct, clear, and if neccessary, fast.
    -   **Best practices for computational projects**: organization and workflows for projects that are easy to reproduce, share and collaborate on.
